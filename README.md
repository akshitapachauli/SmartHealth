Smart Health Prediction & Appointment SystemProject DescriptionThe Smart Health Prediction & Appointment System is a desktop application developed using Java Swing that aims to streamline patient management, health data recording, health risk prediction, and appointment scheduling within a healthcare setting. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for medical staff to manage patient information, record vital health metrics, utilize basic machine learning models for health risk and disease prediction, and efficiently schedule and track appointments.FeaturesPatient Management:Register new patients with detailed demographic and medical history (allergies, medications, existing conditions).View, update, and delete existing patient records.Search for patients by name, email, or phone.View comprehensive patient details including health records and appointments.Health Prediction:Record and manage patient health metrics (heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, temperature, symptoms, stress level, etc.).Utilize a basic Machine Learning (ML) service to predict health risks and potential diseases based on recorded health data.Generate personalized health recommendations.Appointment Management:Schedule new appointments for patients with available doctors.View all scheduled appointments.Mark appointments as completed or cancelled.Database Integration:Persists all patient, doctor, and appointment data using an SQLite database.Includes initial sample data insertion on first run.Option to export/import data and backup the database.Technologies UsedLanguage: JavaGUI Framework: Java SwingDatabase: SQLiteDatabase Connectivity: SQLite JDBC DriverML Components: Simple rule-based implementations for health prediction and recommendations (expandable with external ML libraries/models).Getting StartedFollow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.PrerequisitesJava Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or a newer version installed. You can download it from Oracle's website or use an OpenJDK distribution like Adoptium (Temurin).Verify installation: Open your terminal/command prompt and run java -version and javac -version.SQLite JDBC Driver: This project uses SQLite for data persistence. You need to download the JDBC driver.Go to the SQLite JDBC GitHub releases page.Download the latest sqlite-jdbc-<version>.jar file (e.g., sqlite-jdbc-3.44.1.0.jar).Project Setup and InstallationClone or Download the Project:Download all the provided Java source files.Organize Files:Create a project root directory (e.g., SmartHealthApp). Inside it, create the following folder structure and place the Java files in their respective directories according to their package declarations:SmartHealthApp/

Place JDBC Driver:Move the sqlite-jdbc-<version>.jar file you downloaded into the SmartHealthApp/lib/ directory.Compiling the ProjectOpen your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the SmartHealthApp root directory.Create the bin directory:Linux/macOS:mkdir -p bin
Windows:mkdir bin
Compile the Java source files:Linux/macOS:javac -d bin -cp "lib/*" src/com/healthprediction/model/*.java \
src/com/healthprediction/service/*.java \
src/com/healthprediction/ui/*.java \
src/com/healthprediction/ml/*.java \
src/com/healthprediction/*.java
Windows:javac -d bin -cp "lib\*" src\com\healthprediction\model\*.java ^
src\com\healthprediction\service\*.java ^
src\com\healthprediction\ui\*.java ^
src\com\healthprediction\ml\*.java ^
src\com\healthprediction\*.java
If the compilation is successful, you will not see any output. If there are errors, ensure your file paths and Java code match exactly as provided.Running the ApplicationAfter successful compilation, run the main application class from your SmartHealthApp root directory.Linux/macOS:java -cp "bin:lib/*" com.healthprediction.SmartHealthApp
Windows:java -cp "bin;lib\*" com.healthprediction.SmartHealthApp
UsageUpon launching, a Java Swing application window will appear with multiple tabs:Patient Management:Use the form fields to register new patients.Select a patient from the table to view their details, or to populate the form for updating.Use the "Search" field to filter patients."Delete Patient" will remove the selected patient.Health Prediction:Select an existing patient from the dropdown.Input their latest health metrics and symptoms.Click "Submit Health Record" to save the data.Click "Predict Health & Recommendations" to see the health risk score, predicted diseases, and personalized recommendations.The table below shows the patient's past health records.Appointment Management:Select a patient and a doctor from the dropdowns.Choose an appointment type, date, and time.Click "Schedule Appointment".Existing appointments are listed in the table. You can mark them as "Completed" or "Cancelled".Future EnhancementsMore Sophisticated ML Models: Integrate real machine learning libraries (e.g., Deeplearning4j, Weka, or integrate with Python ML services via a REST API) for more accurate predictions.User Authentication: Implement login functionality for different user roles (admin, doctor, nurse).Reporting and Analytics: Develop more comprehensive reports and visual dashboards (e.g., charts for appointment trends, disease prevalence).Doctor Availability Management: Allow doctors to set their own availability, and enable the system to suggest available slots.Search and Filter Appointments: Add more robust search and filtering options for appointments.Prescription Management: Functionality to generate, save, and print prescriptions.Notifications/Reminders: Implement reminders for upcoming appointments for both patients and doctors.UI/UX Improvements: Enhance the visual design and user experience of the Swing application.LicenseThis project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
